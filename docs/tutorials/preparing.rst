Preparing for the Tutorials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
   Before the tutorials, you will need to download the test files that
   can be found `here <http://data.pennsieve.io/tutorials/example_data.zip>`_

Once you download the files, make sure that you extract the contents of the
compressed folder and place the expanded folder in the same directory in which
you will be running the tutorials.

If you are on a Linux or MacOS system, you can do this by opening a terminal and
running the following:

.. code-block:: console

    curl http://data.pennsieve.io/tutorials/example_data.zip -o example_data.zip
    unzip example_data.zip

You should be able to see the ``example_data`` directory containing the test
files in your current working directory by running the following:

.. code-block:: console

    ls
